JackAnalyzer - 

    A Python program which receives a Jack file (or directory of such files) 
    as a command line argument, and saves the vm files (with the same base filename)
    which contain the compiled VM program.

    First, we tokenize the given Jack file into a token XML file.
    Then, this XML is further analyzed and parsed into the needed hirarchy, according
    to the Jack grammar.
    Finally, the XML is compiled into the VM code, according to the Jack and VM languages
    specifications.

Makefile - Empty (Python program)

README - This file.
