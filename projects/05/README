Submitted Files
---------------
Memory.hdl - The complete address space of the computer's memory, 
including RAM and memory mapped I/O.
 
CPU.hdl - The Central Processing unit (CPU).
Consists of an ALU and a set of registers, designed to fetch and 
execute instructions written in the Hack machine language.

Computer.hdl - The HACK computer, including CPU, ROM and RAM.

ExtendAlu.hdl - An extension of the original ALU, which allows multiplications and shifts.
CpuMul.hdl - An extension of the original CPU which uses the extended ALU,
which allows multiplications and shifts.

Chips copied from projects 2,3, used in ExtendAlu.hdl:
IsNeg16.hdl - Checks if the first bit of a 16-bit buffer is 1 (i.e the number is negative).
ShiftLeft.hdl - Multiplies a 16-buffer by 2.
ShiftRight.hdl - Divides the input 16-bit buffer by 2.
MulStep.hdl - Performs one step of a long multiplication.
Mul.hdl - Multiplies two binary numbers.
Or16Way.hdl - Checks if any of a 16-bit buffer's bits is 1.
