divide/Divide.asm - Divide the two integers saved in R13, R14, and save the result to R15.
Uses the shift-and-subtract algorithm, Runs at O(logn) complexity.

fill/Fill.asm - Runs an infinite loop that listens to the keyboard input. 
When a key is pressed (any key), the program blackens the screen,
i.e. writes "black" in every pixel. When no key is pressed, the
program clears the screen, i.e. writes "white" in every pixel.

mult/Mult.asm - Multiplies R0 and R1 and stores the result in R2.
Uses an addition loop, which adds R1 to R2, R0 times.

sort/Sort.asm - Bubble-Sort a list of integers which starts at the
address saved in R14 and whose length is saved in R15.
Main loop runs N times, and calls an inner loop
which bubbles the smallest numbers upwards (runs N times as well).
Total complexity O(N^2).
