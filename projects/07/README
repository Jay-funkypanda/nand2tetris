VMtranslator - 

    A Python program which receives a VM file (or directory of such files) 
    as a command line argument, and saves a .asm file(s) (with the same base filename)
    which contains the translated ASM program.

    The program iterates over all the program's lines, and translates them into
    the needed ASM code segments.

    Most of the commands were explicitly translated according to the required code
    sequences, built according to our experience with the ASM language from past projects,
    and the VM language structure specified in chapter 7.

Makefile - Empty (Python program)

README - This file.

Remarks

None.
