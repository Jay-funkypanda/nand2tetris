VMtranslator - 

    A Python program which receives a VM file (or directory of such files) 
    as a command line argument, and saves a .asm file(s) (with the same base filename)
    which contains the translated ASM program.

    The program iterates over all the program's lines, and translates them into
    the needed ASM code segments.

    Most of the commands were explicitly translated according to the required code
    sequences, built according to our experience with the ASM language from past projects,
    and the VM language structure specified in chapter 7.

Makefile - Empty (Python program)

Remarks
-------
To handle eq,lt,gt commands - 
In order to implement those, we had to use jumps to sections that fill the appropriate
truth value in the stack.
Since this involved subtracting two numbers, we had to handle the possibility of
integer overflow (i.e subtracting two numbers where the result would be
greater that 32767 or less than -32767).
To handle this issue, we separated the jump cases to the case where the two numbers
have the same sign (which means you can safely subtract them), and the case where
they have different signs, in which case we can check only the first number.
We used R13 and R14 as temporary variables to hold the numbers that are currently
at the top of the stack.
