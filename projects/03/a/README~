Submitted Files
---------------

HalfAdder.hdl - Computes the sum of two bits and carry value.
FullAdder.hdl - Computes the sum of three bits and carry value.
Add16.hdl - Adds two 16-bit values. The most-significant carry bit is ignored.
Inc16.hdl - 16-bit incrementer: out = in + 1 (arithmetic addition).
ALU.hdl - Computes one of several functions on two input 16-bit buffers and given flags.

ShiftLeft.hdl - Multiplies a 16-buffer by 2.

IsNeg16.hdl - Checks if the first bit of a 16-bit buffer is 1 (i.e the number is negative).
ShiftRight.hdl - Divides the input 16-bit buffer by 2.

MulStep.hdl - Performs one step of a long multiplication.
Mul.hdl - Multiplies two binary numbers.

README - This file.

Remarks
-------
Two helper chips were added:

IsNeg16, which checks whether a buffer represents a negative number, is used in ShiftRight chip,
in order to conserve the sign of the shift's input.

MulStep, which performs one step of a bitwise multiplication, is used 16 times in the Mul chip,
in order to multiply the two numbers as a whole.
